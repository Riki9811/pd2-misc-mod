## Cheat info

All features tagged with [CHEAT] **do not give you the cheater tag**, but I still consider them as straight up cheating the game, because they alter/ruin the experience of PayDay. I just implemented them because they are useful for mod testing purposes.</br>
Since the mod has this cheating features I can't upload it to [ModWorkshop](https://modworkshop.net/game/payday-2).

## **Crash/error warning**

I've written this collection of features mainly for my own usage, and **I don't intend to keep updating** the code if something breaks over time. Everybody is free to use the mod, but I do not guarantee that it won't crash the game.
